Feldspar is split in two packages that can be downloaded from Hackage:

[Feldspar-language](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/feldspar-language) which is always necessary.

[Feldspar-compiler](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/feldspar-compiler) which is only needed if you want to generate C-code.

Type cabal install <package> in your terminal window
if you have the [Haskell Platform](http://haskell.org/platform) installed.
