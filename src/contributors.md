Feldspar is currently being developed by projects at [Chalmers University of Technology](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/FP/FP), [SICS Swedish ICT AB](http://www.sics.se) and [Ericsson AB](http://www.ericsson.com).

[ELTE University](http://www.elte.hu/en/) contributed to the initial implementation of Feldspar, particularly the [feldspar-compiler](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/feldspar-compiler) back end.

Feldspar is available under a BSD license and is openly developed on github. Contributions and improvements are always welcome.
